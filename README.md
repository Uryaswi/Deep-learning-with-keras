# Deep-learning-with-keras
#a regression model is been built using the keras library
#npo of training epochs were increased witha change in the number of hidden layers to check if the changes are impacting the performance of the model.
# As a result one of the factors included the mean and the standard deviation of the mean squared errors which in case D is less than in case A, B and C. And it's the only case where error is not very big. It means additional layers in neural network are helping and is an important factor to detect error.
